Overview of the project: Model evaluation and comparison 
*Model Evaluation Objectives:*

1. *Performance Measurement*: Assess the RL agent's performance in the game environment using metrics such as:
    - Cumulative rewards
    - Win/loss rate
    - Game completion time
    - Score or points achieved
2. *Stability and Consistency*: Evaluate the agent's ability to maintain performance over time, including:
    - Variance in rewards or scores
    - Consistency in decision-making
3. *Robustness and Generalization*: Test the agent's ability to adapt to:
    - New game levels or scenarios
    - Changes in game dynamics or rules
    - Different initial conditions or starting states
4. *Efficiency and Scalability*: Measure the agent's computational efficiency and scalability, including:
    - Training time and resources required
    - Inference time and resources required

*Model Comparison Objectives:*

1. *Performance Comparison*: Compare the performance of different RL agents or algorithms, including:
    - Cumulative rewards or scores
    - Win/loss rates
    - Game completion times
2. *Algorithmic Differences*: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different RL algorithms, including:
    - Q-Learning vs. SARSA vs. DQN vs. PGMs
    - On-policy vs. off-policy learning
    - Model-based vs. model-free learning
3. *Hyperparameter Sensitivity*: Analyze the sensitivity of RL agents to hyperparameter changes, including:
    - Learning rate
    - Exploration rate
    - Discount factor
    - Batch size
4. *Ablation Studies*: Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of individual components or features to the agent's performance, including:
    - Feature importance
    - Component removal or addition
